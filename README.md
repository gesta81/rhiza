# Strong roots
Creating and maintaining technical harmony across repositories.

A collection of reusable configuration templates
for modern Python projects.
Save time and maintain consistency across your projects
with these pre-configured templates.

![Last Updated](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/jebel-quant/rhiza/main?label=Last%20updated&color=blue)

In the original Greek, spelt **ῥίζα**, pronounced *ree-ZAH*, and having the literal meaning **root**.

## 🌟 Why Rhiza?

**Unlike traditional project templates** (like cookiecutter or copier) that generate a one-time snapshot of configuration files, **Rhiza provides living templates** that evolve with your project. Classic templates help you start a project, but once generated, your configuration drifts away from the template as best practices change. Rhiza takes a different approach: it enables **continuous synchronization**, allowing you to selectively pull template updates into your project over time through automated workflows. This means you can benefit from improvements to CI/CD workflows, linting rules, and development tooling without manually tracking upstream changes. Think of it as keeping your project's foundation fresh and aligned with modern practices, while maintaining full control over what gets updated.

### How It Works

Rhiza uses a simple configuration file (`.rhiza/template.yml`) to control which templates sync to your project:

```yaml
# .rhiza/template.yml
repository: Jebel-Quant/rhiza
ref: v0.7.1

include: |
  .github/workflows/*.yml
  .pre-commit-config.yaml
  ruff.toml
  pytest.ini
  Makefile

exclude: |
  .rhiza/scripts/customisations/*
```

**What you're seeing:**
- **`repository`** - The upstream template source (**can be any repository, not just Rhiza!**)
- **`ref`** - Which version tag/branch to sync from (e.g., `v0.7.1` or `main`)
- **`include`** - File patterns to pull from the template (CI workflows, linting configs, etc.)
- **`exclude`** - Paths to skip, protecting your customisations

> **💡 Automated Updates:** When using a version tag (e.g., `v0.7.1`) instead of a branch name, Renovate will automatically create pull requests to update the `ref` field when new versions are released. This keeps your templates up-to-date with minimal manual intervention. 
>
> To enable this in your project, copy the [`regexManagers` configuration](renovate.json#L31-L40) from this repository's `renovate.json` file into your own Renovate configuration. See the linked configuration for the complete setup.

When you run `uvx rhiza materialize` or trigger the automated sync workflow, Rhiza fetches only the files matching your `include` patterns, skips anything in `exclude`, and creates a clean diff for you to review. You stay in control of what updates and when.

**💡 Pro Tip:** While you can use `Jebel-Quant/rhiza` directly, **we recommend creating your own template repository** using GitHub's "Use this template" button. This gives you a clean copy to customise for your organisation's specific needs and constraints—adjusting CI workflows, coding standards, or tooling choices—while still benefiting from Rhiza's sync mechanism. Your template repo becomes your team's source of truth, and you can selectively pull updates from upstream Rhiza when desired.

```python
# Example code block
import math
print("Hello, World!")
print(1 + 1)
print(round(math.pi, 2))
print(round(math.cos(math.pi/4.0), 2))
```

```result
Hello, World!
2
3.14
0.71
```

### Documentation Customisation

For information on customising the look and feel of your documentation, see [book/README.md](book/README.md).

### Python Version Management

The `.python-version` file specifies the default Python version for local development. Tools like `uv` and `pyenv` automatically use this version. Simply update this file to change your local Python version.

### Makefile Customisation

Rhiza uses a modular Makefile system with extension points (hooks) for customisation. See [.rhiza/make.d/README.md](.rhiza/make.d/README.md) for the complete guide including:
- Extension points and hooks
- Custom target creation
- Module ordering conventions

### Custom Build Scripts

For system dependencies and custom build steps, see [docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md](docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md).

### Private GitHub Packages

Rhiza's template workflows automatically support private GitHub packages from the same organization. Simply add them to your `pyproject.toml`:

**In `pyproject.toml`:**
```toml
[tool.uv.sources]
my-package = { git = "https://github.com/jebel-quant/my-package.git", rev = "v1.0.0" }
```

**Git authentication is already configured** in all Rhiza workflows (CI, book, release, etc.) using the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`, which automatically provides read access to repositories in the same organization.

For custom workflows or local development setup, see [.rhiza/docs/PRIVATE_PACKAGES.md](.rhiza/docs/PRIVATE_PACKAGES.md).

### Release Management

For information on versioning, tagging, and publishing releases, see [.rhiza/docs/RELEASING.md](.rhiza/docs/RELEASING.md).

### Dev Container

This repository includes a template Dev Container configuration for seamless development in VS Code and GitHub Codespaces. See [.devcontainer/README.md](.devcontainer/README.md) for setup, configuration, and troubleshooting.

For details about the VS Code extensions configured in the Dev Container, see [docs/VSCODE_EXTENSIONS.md](docs/VSCODE_EXTENSIONS.md).
