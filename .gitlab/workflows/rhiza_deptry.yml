# Workflow: Deptry (GitLab CI)
#
# Purpose: This workflow identifies missing and obsolete dependencies in the project.
#          It helps maintain a clean dependency tree by detecting unused packages and
#          implicit dependencies that should be explicitly declared.
#
# Trigger: This workflow runs on every push and on merge requests to main/master
#          branches (including from forks)
